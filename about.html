	<p>Today’s digital marketplace is swift. It’s bold. Let’s be honest: it’s a little bit cutthroat.</p>
	<p>It’s not good enough to have software that looks good but underperforms. Or software that is programmed well but doesn’t deliver on the user experience.</p> 
	<p>The future is digital. If companies aren’t keeping pace in this fast-paced digital landscape, delivering both reliable performance and an elegant interface, they’re losing customers.</p>
	<p>Rogue Theorem believes code should be as clean and well designed as the user interface, marrying attention to detail with clarity, simplicity and style.</p>
